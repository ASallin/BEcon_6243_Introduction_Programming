The format looks like this:\n  find [dirname] -name [filename]\nLet’s find the file called file-001.txt:\n  find . -name \"file-001.txt\"\nThis will look in the current directory, which is represented with a dot.\nWe can look in other directories as well. Let’s create a file in our home folder called test.txt\n  touch ~/test.txt\nTo find that file:\n  find ~/ -name \"test.txt\"\nWe can look for files that match a certain pattern as well. Let’s find all files that start with file-:\n  find . -name \"file-*\"\nWe can search for files that are empty:\n  find . -empty\nLet’s append some text to the file file-002.txt. We could use the cat command, like I showed you earlier, but we can also use the echo command:\n  echo \"Hello World\" &gt;&gt; file-002.txt\nNow if we find the empty files again, we will see that file-002.txt is no longer empty:\n  find . -empty\nWe can remove all of the files that we created with this command:\n  find . -name \"file-*\" -delete\n  rm -f file-* # This will also work\nThere is so much more that you can do with the find command, but it goes beyond the scope of this tutorial."

Use git status to understand what is happening.\nSolution: the danger is that at this moment, it could be that my colleagues have pushed conflicting changes to the repo.\n\n\nAction\nNow pull the remote repo again.
