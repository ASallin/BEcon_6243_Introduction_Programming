# Welcome to Introduction to Programming!


# Vision for this course


## {class="inverse" background-image="../../img/mechanics.webp" background-size="100%" background-repeat="cover"}


## By the end of the course, you will be able to...

- [**Use essential tools for working with data**]{.green-bold} <br> We will work with the programming language R, but the concepts apply to any programming language.
- [**Manage a data project from start to finish**]{.green-bold} <br> You will practice collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to carry out a complete project in Economics (research, consulting, ...).
- [**Formulate meaningful questions from data**]{.green-bold} <br> You will learn how to explore datasets and identify relevant questions.
- [**Communicate insights effectively**]{.green-bold} <br> You will gain experience in presenting results clearly and persuasively.



## My commitment to these goals and to your learning process

- **Transferrable skills**
- **Hands-on approach**
- **Emphasis on real-world relevance** <br>(caveat: this course is mandatory for Econ students, I have limited freedom in the syllabus)
- **As much fun as possible (as coding can be fun...😎)**



## Your commitment to the course

- Prepare with reading, visit the lecture, recap key concepts in lecture notes (self-study)
- Work on exercises, come to exercise session, tackle the tricky exercises together!
- Code, code, and code. repeat...
- 🤖 Use AI as a learning companion and sparring partner, not as a crutch 🩼! (more on that later)

```{r}
try <- 0
while(try < 999) {
  try <- try + 1
}
cat("success!")
```

# How to best use AI for this course

<br>

## 1. Use AI as your Learning Companion

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
❌ Ask AI to write full programs for you  

✅ Ask **structured questions** based on your own knowledge (idea: knowledge reinforcement)

✅ Use AI to explore unknown and new approaches  

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

You want to compute the mean of each element of the list `x`.

```{r}
x <- list(
  c(1,2,3), 
  c(4,5,6)
  )
```

- **Ask AI**:
“I know that the function to compute the mean is `mean()`, and I know that it takes atomic vectors as argument. How do I apply the mean to each vector in the list? Give me two options, and explain pros/cons?”
:::
::::




## 2. Use AI to better understand your code

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

✅ Use AI as a translator

✅ Ask for explanations in plain language

✅ Get step-by-step descriptions

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

You have the following piece of code:

```{r}
mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3, 11,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, 
             byrow = TRUE,
             dimnames = list(c("row1", "row2"),
                             c("C.1", "C.2", "C.3")))
mat[1,] <- mat[1, ] + 10
mat[1,] == mat[2,]
```

**Ask AI**:
“Explain line by line what this R code does in plain English. What does the option `byrow = TRUE` do?”
:::
::::




## 3. Use AI to debug

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

✅ Share error messages and context

✅ Ask for possible causes

✅ Ask for alternative solutions

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

You try:

```r
log("text")
```

R sends the following error message: "non-numeric argument to mathematical function"

**Ask AI**:
“Why does this error occur in R and how can I fix it?”
:::
::::


## 4. Use AI as your Motivational Coach 🔥

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
✅ Ask for tips to stay motivated and understand **WHY** you're learning what you're learning

✅ Ask for ways to make coding more enjoyable and directly relevant to your goals

✅ Ask for ways to make your code and thinking process more like the product of experts

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
You don't see the point of learning to code functions and loops since AI can do it for you. 

**Ask AI**:
“Why is learning to program functions important for an economist/data scientist? Give me some real-life examples. ”
:::
::::
