This folder contains weekly lecture materials and resources for the course.

Each week's materials will be organized in separate subfolders (e.g., `week_01/`, `week_02/`, etc.) and may include:

- Lecture slides
- Code examples
- Reading materials
- Additional resources

Materials will be added progressively throughout the semester.
