Something changes on GitHub (your colleague pushed a change). GitHub will automatically add a new line to theMeaningOfEverything.py. In this simulated situation, your local files are unchanged but the the remote repository is ahead.\nAfter 1 minute, pull again. You should notice the change. Look at git status to follow the difference.\n\n\nLocal vs remote\nNow you should have an theMeaningOfEverything.py file that looks like this:\n\n\"\"\"\nThe Meaning of Everything\n==========================\n\"\"\"\n\na = 6 * 7\nb = 14 * 3\nc = sum([40,2])\n\n# Define a function that returns the meaning of everything\n\ndef meaning_of_everything():\n    return 42  # &lt;- change here\n\n\n# Print the results\n\nprint(\"Result:\", c)\nprint(\"Meaning of everything:\", meaning_of_everything())\n\n# Test\n\nif a == b == c == meaning_of_everything():\n    print(\"All values are equal to 42, which proves that 42 is indeed the meaning of everything!\")\n\nEverything is synchronized. Git would send you the following message: “Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/main’. Nothing to commit, working tree clean”.\nSince you now know the answer, change your answer to 42 in theMeaningOfEverything.py and push your changes."

We already know that the touch command will create a file. It can also be used to create multiple files.\n  touch file-{001..100}.txt\nNow we have 100 .txt files in the current directory. Something that would have taken a lot longer to do in the GUI.\nLet’s do something very simple and find a specific file. The format looks like this:\n  find [dirname] -name [filename]\nLet’s find the file called file-001.txt:\n  find . -name \"file-001.txt\"\nThis will look in the current directory, which is represented with a dot.\nWe can look in other directories as well. Let’s create a file in our home folder called test.txt\n  touch ~/test.txt\nTo find that file:\n  find ~/ -name \"test.txt\"\nWe can look for files that match a certain pattern as well. Let’s find all files that start with file-:\n  find . -name \"file-*\"\nWe can search for files that are empty:\n  find . -empty\nLet’s append some text to the file file-002.txt. We could use the cat command, like I showed you earlier, but we can also use the echo command:\n  echo \"Hello World\" &gt;&gt; file-002.txt\nNow if we find the empty files again, we will see that file-002.txt is no longer empty:\n  find . -empty\nWe can remove all of the files that we created with this command:\n  find . -name \"file-*\" -delete\n  rm -f file-* # This will also work\nThere is so much more that you can do with the find command, but it goes beyond the scope of this tutorial."

Then push your changes to remote.\nSolution:\ngit status\ngit add exercise.txt # or git add .\ngit commit -m \"Fill in exercise\"\ngit push\n\n\nCheck changes in remote\nAfter your first push, do nothing for a moment. Something changes on GitHub (your colleague pushed a change). GitHub will automatically add a new line to exercise.txt. In this simulated situation, your local files are unchanged but the the remote repository is ahead.\n\n\nLocal commits vs remote commits\nWe are in the situation where you have already pushed once and the remote repo has changed. Imagine you forgot to pull the remote and you are working ahead on your local directory.\nOpen exercise.txt again. Add a new line at the end, for example: “I made another local change before pulling.” Save the file and commit. Do not push yet.\nSolution:\ngit status\ngit add exercise.txt\ngit commit -m \"Add another local change\"\nAt this point, you are ahead locally and the remote is also ahead. The histories have “diverged”.\nNow pull the changes to your computer, then open exercise.txt again. Check the changes using git status. Notice the new commits in your GUI.\nSolution:\ngit pull\nYour local changes are not erased: Git combines your local commit and the remote commit. The file now contains both changes.\nCheck the history in your GUI.\ngit log --oneline\nAs a final step, push the combined history back to GitHub.\n\nKey takeaway\nIf the remote is ahead, and you commit locally, and you then pull, Git does not delete your work, but tries to combine the histories automatically."
