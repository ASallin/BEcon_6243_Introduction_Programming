## Cloning a repository: course repo

Clone the course repo as shown in class in your course directory.


## Cloning a repository

For this exercise, we've prepared a GitHub Classroom. A GitHub Classroom is a special type of repository created for a class, where each student gets their own copy to complete and submit assignments. It works like a normal GitHub repository. We will use it for the group project.

### Connect to the repo
With the following link https://classroom.github.com/a/LrPyk79h, accept the invitaton to connect. Once you've accepted the invitation, you should see a link to a repository:

![](../../assets/img/githubclassroom_invitation.png)

### Clone
Clone the repository using either HTTPS or SSH. Make sure you are cloning the repository in the directory `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming/exercises/week03`. Check that your repo has been downloaded using `git status`.

```
BECON_4222_Introduction_programming/
├── BECON_4222_Introduction_Programming/
├── exercises/              # Student's own work
│   ├── week01/
│   ├── week02/
│   ├── ...
│   ├── week12/
├── group_project/
│   ├── ...

```

Solution:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<their-repo>.git
cd <their-repo>
git status
```


## Pushing and pulling

### First edit + push

Open `theMeaningOfEverything.py` (best if you use VSCode, but you can also use any other editor). Edit the file following the instructions. Then push your changes to remote.


Solution:

```bash
git status
git add theMeaningOfEverything.py # or git add .
git commit -m "Fill in exercise"
git push
```


### Check changes in remote

After your first push, do nothing for a moment. Something changes on GitHub (your colleague pushed a change). GitHub will automatically add a new line to `theMeaningOfEverything.py`. In this simulated situation, your local files are unchanged but the the remote repository is ahead.

After 1 minute, pull again. You should notice the change. Look at git status to follow the difference.


### Local vs remote

Now you should have an `theMeaningOfEverything.py` file that looks like this:

```{python}
#| eval : false

"""
The Meaning of Everything
==========================
"""

a = 6 * 7
b = 14 * 3
c = sum([40,2])

# Define a function that returns the meaning of everything

def meaning_of_everything():
    return 42  # <- change here


# Print the results

print("Result:", c)
print("Meaning of everything:", meaning_of_everything())

# Test

if a == b == c == meaning_of_everything():
    print("All values are equal to 42, which proves that 42 is indeed the meaning of everything!")
```

Everything is synchronized. Git would send you the following message: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. Nothing to commit, working tree clean".

Since you now know the answer, change your answer to 42 in ``theMeaningOfEverything.py`` and push your changes.


## Conflicts with remote

Let's simulate another situation in which your local version conflicts with the remote version. Change the function in `theMeaningOfEverything.py` with another number (make sure you have one and only one empty line inbetween):

```{python}
#| eval : false
"""
The Meaning of Everything
==========================
"""

a = 6 * 7
b = 14 * 3
c = sum([40,2])

# Define a function that returns the meaning of everything

def meaning_of_everything():
    return 99  # <- change here


# Print the results

print("Result:", c)
print("Meaning of everything:", meaning_of_everything())

# Test

if a == b == c == meaning_of_everything():
    print(\"All values are equal to 42, which proves that 42 is indeed the meaning of everything!\")
```

Then add and commit locally, but do not push.


### Reflection

Before running any code, reflect on the situation you are in. What is happening? What could have happened? Use `git status` to understand what is happening.

Solution: the danger is that at this moment, it could be that my colleagues have pushed conflicting changes to the repo.

### Action

Now pull the remote repo again. You should see a conflict: "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in `theMeaningOfEverything.py`" Explain why. How do you solve the conflict?

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
I agree.
=======
you are now closer to the TRUTH
>>>>>>> f4b343b02f6bfc29d7fe78f2551a6ba90e2b172d
```

The conflict must be solved. In this case, you can easily choose between the two lines. In longer code, this requires going through each line. For this exercise, please choose "Accept both changes", and have the following file:

```
Step 1:
Aurelien.

Step 2:
Complete the following sentence: “The answer to everything is 42.”

The answer is close to 42 🤖

I agree.
you are now closer to the TRUTH
```



## Branching and a first merge conflict

### Create a new branch

Create and switch to a new branch called `answer-42`. Check where you are.

Solution:
```bash
git checkout -b answer-42
git branch
```

You should see `answer-42` marked with *.


### Changes on the branch

Open ``theMeaningOfEverything.py``. Find the sentence: "The answer is close to 42 🤖". Replace it with "The answer is equal to 42 🤖".

Save the file and commit with a meaningful commit message.

Solution:
```bash
git add `theMeaningOfEverything.py`
git commit -m "Answer the ultimate question"
```


### Push the branch

Push the branch to GitHub. Open the repository on GitHub. You should now see two branches.

Solution:
```bash
git push -u origin answer-42
```

You can now continue to push on your branch. You notice that the text file on exercise contains the merged conflicts. In some way, you are ahead of main with your branch: "This branch is 1 commit ahead of main".


### Conflicting change (more advanced)
Now merge both branches, from `answer-42` into main.

```
git checkout main
git merge answer-42
git status
```

Notice the message: On branch main- Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged, and have 2 and 1 different commits each, respectively. (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours).

If you try to push, you'll receive the following message:

```
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

#### Reflection: what has happened?

#### Action

As suggested, pull remote main. Now you'll have a conflict to solve (The answer is equal to 42 🤖 <-> The answer is close to 42 🤖). Solve the conflict by chosing "The answer is equal to 42 🤖" and push to remote.



## Bonus Adding your own repository to Github

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `git-intro-example`
    - Make sure NOT to add a README or any other file when creating it
2. Create an empty dir in your week_03 folder.
2. Ad the just created GitHub repo as a remote
    - `git remote add origin <URL>`
3. Push you changes so far to GitHub
   - `git push -u origin main`
