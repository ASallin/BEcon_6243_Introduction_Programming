# Set up your course directory

Create a directory for the course on your computer: `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming` using the terminal. Use command prompt or powershell. From there, navigate to the path of your choice using `cd` and create the directory using `mkdir`.

We will have the following folder structure throughout the course. Notice our personal preference for snake case.

```bash
BECON_4222_Introduction_programming/
├── materials/              # is empty for now, you will clone the git repo in week 3
├── exercises/              # Student's own work
│   ├── week_01/
│   ├── week_02/
│   ├── ...
│   ├── week_12/
├── group_project/
│   ├── ...

```

where `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming` is the main folder, `materials` will be created next week with git, and `group_project` will contain students' own work.

# Install VS Code

Now install VS Code on your computer. Follow instructions online.

Create the "data science profile". See here for an introduction: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles)

<!-- @Aurelien: there is no data science profile mentioned - this certainly will lead to confusion. We should be specific what profile we expect students to set up. Also, we should tell them why such profiles are important and what they are needed for. -->
  
Get familiar with VS Code. Open a terminal (on Windows, you might want to choose between powershell or command prompt). Understand what extensions are. In VScode, you should observe a left bar. In this bar, there is a tab for git, for extensions, etc. The first tab is usually your file access tab.

Install the following extensions:

  - **Python** (Microsoft): For linting, IntelliSense, debugging, and testing
  - **Pylance** (Microsoft): type checking, code navigation, autocompletion
  - **Ruff**: for better linting, import sorting
  - **Jupyter**: runs notebooks directly in VS Code.

<br>

# Use the terminal in VS Code

0. You should always make VS Code start from the directory your are working in. You can do this in the following ways:

    1. Either use your terminal and navigate to `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming` using `cd`. Then use `code .` to open VS code in your directory.
    2. You can also open VS Code, and then use File/Open Folder.

1. In VS Code, open a terminal. In the terminal, understand where you are located. Find your current path directory using `pwd`.
2. Create a file "hello.txt" in the `exercises/week_01` folder. Remove the file "hello.txt".
3. Finally, move your working directory to `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming`.

# Install python via `uv`

You can use the following commands in your terminal to set everything up. Remember, left click works like copy-paste in many terminals. Go on the `uv` website for more information on how to install.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

```powershell
# Install uv using standalone installer
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Add uv to PATH (follow instructions in the terminal)
$env:PATH = $env:PATH + ";$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"

# Make the PATH change permanent
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin", "User")

# Verify installation
uv
```

### Mac

```bash
# Install uv standalone installer
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or using pip
pip install uv

# Verify installation
uv --version
```
:::

Then check if it works in your terminal:

```bash
uv
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
PS C:/.../BEcon_4222_Introduction_Programming> uv
An extremely fast Python package manager.

Usage: uv.exe [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  auth     Manage authentication
  run      Run a command or script
  init     Create a new project
  add      Add dependencies to the project
  ...
```

<br>

### Install python using `uv`

Now, we can install python. If Python is already installed on your system (on Windows mostly the case), `uv` will detect and use it without configuration.

```bash
uv python install
```

We will use Python 3.

<br>

### Create a project for the lecture (your "environment")

<!-- @Aurelien: What is a bit annoying, is that it automatically creates a main.py file. Using python3 -m venv .venv. we could avoid this. I am wondering if, given that we stress the importance of having different environments for different projects, it would make more sense to create individual environments for every exercise? That way students get some practice in setting them up. Also, I have a follow-up question: in the bash, I must activate my environment in order to work in it. Does this happen with uv too? I don't see us doing it here so I conclude that uv is doing that in the background automatically based on the pwd. Happy to discuss :) -->

Remember, in the lecture we mentioned the importance of "closed environments" for Python. This is different than in R. To create a closed environment, we use a project with `uv`, which will manage our python version and our packages.

In the terminal, use `uv init` to initialize your project. Make sure you are in your working directory `~/BECON_4222_Introduction_programming`. Then specify the version of python we will use in this environment. We will use python 3.14 (for this course, it does not matter much).

```bash
uv init --python 3.14.3
```


You should observe the creation of different files:

```bash
BECON_4222_Introduction_programming/
├── .python-version          # Specifies Python version (3.14.1) for this project
├── pyproject.toml           # Project configuration file. Defines project dependencies and settings
├── .gitignore               # Instructions for git. We will see this next week.
├── README.md                #  README text file that contains your basic project documentation. Feel free to add some information. The syntax is `markdown` (`md`) syntax.
└── main.py                  # Example Python script
```

<!-- @Aurelien - students can likely delete the main.py file (via the terminal?). -->

Now, we will install the following python packages in our environment: `ipykernel`, `pandas`, `numpy`. Install them using `uv add `

```bash
uv add ipykernel pandas numpy
```

<!-- @Aurelien - it might make sense to work with requirements.txt for dependencies. Saves a lot of typing and allows exactly matching environments when students work in groups. -->

You should oberve different things happening:
  - the creation of a `.venv` folder, which contains your isolated Python environment
  - your file `pyproject.toml` being updated under "dependencies"

# Using a python script in VS code

Once in `BECON_4222_Introduction_programming`, open the `main.py`. The trick now is to **choose the right python interpreter**. Python interpreters are programs that read and execute your Python code. Each environment can have its own interpreter, which ensures you use the correct Python version and packages for your project. Since we defined our Python installation, we need to select the interpreter we chose from our `uv` environment.

- In VS Code, use CTRL + SHIFT + P to open the palette. Then write "Select Python Interpreter". There will be a list of available Python interpreters. Chose the one corresponding to Python 3.14.1 in your `venv` (tagged "Workspace" by VS Code).

- In VS Code, if you have a `.py` file open, check the Python interpreter at the bottom right and make sure you have the right one selected.

## Create a Python script

Create a first python script called `hello.py`, which contains the command `print('hello world')`. Run it from the script and run it with uv using the following command:

```bash
uv run hello.py
```

In the python file, right click and select "Run in Interactive Window". You've run your first Python script of the course. 🎊
